# Inputfield Page Dependent Select

This inputfield works like PageListSelect, but instead of a tree it shows multiple selectboxes, where you choose your path one by one to the pages deepest in the tree. By now this only works for hierachies, where the branches have the same depth and only pages on the last level are saved. 

This will most likely be of small interest for usage in the ProcessWire admin, but it's a great addition as inputfield in FormBuilder.
